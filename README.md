# DataExtender
DataExtender is a platform to transform the data from one format to another, usually from the format of a source system into the required format of a new destination system. The usual process involves converting documents, but data conversions sometimes involve the conversion of a program from one computer language to another to enable the program to run on a different platform. The usual reason for this data migration is the adoption of a new system that's totally different from the previous one. The beauty about DataExtender is that it can be run a cross computer operation systems as it is an open source that can be used with the most common data types known today.
